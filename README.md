# zfg
Single file C libraries for games with a focus on prototyping speed and least lines of code as possible.
Allot of these constitute "bad" code, using static variables in functions, undefined behavior, not being
portable, etc; none of them are really intended for well made, non-crashing programs, just for prototypes.
